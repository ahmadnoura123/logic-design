# Logic-Controlled Board â€“ Digital Logic Design Project

A digital system implemented using **Finite State Machines (FSM)** and simulated on **Quartus II**.  
The board detects the last switch turned off and triggers dynamic LED patterns based on specific logic rules.

## ðŸš€ Features
- FSM-based sequential logic implementation  
- Dynamic LED control responding to switch states  
- Simulation and timing analysis in Quartus II  
- Design validation through test benches and waveform inspection  

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack
Quartus II â€¢ FSM â€¢ Flip-Flops â€¢ Logic Gates â€¢ Sequence Design â€¢ Simulation Tools

## ðŸ“š Learning Outcomes
Applied theoretical digital logic to real hardware simulation.  
Learned to translate boolean logic into sequential system design with predictable behavior.
